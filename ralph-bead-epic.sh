# Ralph Pattern: Finish a Beads Epic
#
# Runs Claude in an autonomous loop to complete all tasks in a Beads epic.
# Claude operates bd directly - the script just loops until COMPLETE.
#
# Beads: https://github.com/steveyegge/beads
#
# Usage: ./ralph-bead-epic.sh <max-iterations> [epic-id]
#
# If epic-id is omitted, automatically selects the highest priority ready epic.
#
# Prerequisites:
# - Claude CLI installed
# - Beads CLI installed (bd)

BEADS EPIC RALPH - ITERATION $i

Epic: $EPIC_ID

PROCESS:
1. Run 'bd ready' to see unblocked tasks for epic $EPIC_ID.
2. If no tasks remain in this epic, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise> and stop.
3. Pick the highest priority ready task from this epic.
4. Implement it fully - code, tests, verification.
5. Run tests to ensure nothing broke.
6. Mark complete: bd done <task-id>
7. Commit changes: git add -A && git commit -m \"feat(<task-id>): <brief description>\"
8. Add iteration note: bd note $EPIC_ID \"Iteration $i: <task-id> | <what you did> | <any blockers or learnings>\"
9. Summarize what you did.

RULES:
- Complete ONE task per iteration.
- Always leave tests passing.
- Only work on tasks under epic $EPIC_ID.
- Use bd commands directly (bd ready, bd show, bd done, bd note, bd block).
- Always run bd note after completing a task - this is required, not optional.
- Only output <promise>COMPLETE</promise> when bd ready shows no remaining tasks for this epic.

AUTONOMY:
- You are running NON-INTERACTIVELY. Never ask questions or wait for input.
- Make smart autonomous decisions - install dependencies, choose reasonable defaults.
- For small installs (Go, Node, Python packages): just do it.
- For large installs (>1GB like Xcode, Android SDK, Docker images): output <promise>EJECT: <reason></promise> instead.
- If truly blocked (missing credentials, unclear requirements): output <promise>BLOCKED: <reason></promise>.
